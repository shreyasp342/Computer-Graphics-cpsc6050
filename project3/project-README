Project 3: Show Me The Bunny!!

	Description:  
		Renders a bunny inside a Cornell Box and uses Keller's Instant Radiosity to
		render the lighting.
		
		Note: We added two new planes, where the original "roof" and "floor" are, but slightly offset 
		      respectively to show more of our color bleeding. The original geometry was very dim in 
		      comparison to our right and left walls. We felt that it was necessary to add this component 
		      to better emulate a traditional Cornell Box.
